I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, building generative-AI applications that connect code with culture. My current obsession is **Caeliai**—an open research project probing how machine-learning models can grasp fashion aesthetics, style, and design principles.

Follow the journey as I progress from vision embeddings to custom retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, self-hosted fine-tuning workflows, and production-level inference.
